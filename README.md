# Purpose

A RESTful service to make it easy for employees to track their *competencies* as well as others’. Useful for tracking learning (technical, managerial, etc.) as well as finding experts (e.g., for code review). *Mastery levels* can be specified for each competency and employee, and could follow a simplified version of [Bloom’s taxonomy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloom%27s_taxonomy) (or any other custom one); they get acquired via *learning sources* and assessed by *assessors* (team lead, peer, in-house instructor, etc.). 

Competencies can be organized in hierarchies (think: area, subarea, etc.). At the leaf level, they can be used to express *learning outcomes*.

One can also express *prerequisites* between competencies.

Ideally would connect to existing tools (HR/employee list) or even be simply an extension thereof.

# Current status and roadmap

[x] provide a Model for competencies (as per the short description above); 
[x] a REST API for CRUD
[ ] generate custom competency map of prerequisites, with links to the relevant employees, teams, learning material, etc.;
[x] scripts to upload competencies from various sources, mostly spreadsheets in various forms;
[ ] a front-end to visualize and track progress, to assess, to navigate, etc.

# HOWTO

See our controller specs for examples.
